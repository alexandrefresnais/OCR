This is a Optical Character Recognition Software made for a second year project in EPITA.

The group was made of :
    - Kevin Cousin,
    - Alexandre Fresnais(Project Manager)
    - Quentin Lamirault
    - Romain Marchais

Note that this is not the perfect solution for such a software but it is a real convenient one
for the time we had.

If you are using our project or if you got inspired by it, please let us know by sending an email to alexandre.fresnais@epita.fr

Here some things you might want to know if you are using/looking at our project :

To make our project work correctly, please use simple documents.
Our OCR can normally detect images inside a document and delete them to recognize the text.
Note that text written in Serif Font might lead to uncoherent results because we did not train our neural network for it.
Noisy documents might not work too.
A problem with accent is known, so you might have some problems with GTK if the text or the corrected text contains accent.
